# French Vanilla nvim

Hodgepodge [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org)-based config.

Trying to keep my configuration as minimal & "vanilla" as possible, but adding some essential quality-of-life improvements.

## Requirements

See requirements for [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/#%EF%B8%8F-requirements).

LazyVim will auto-pickup the config if placed in `~/.config/nvim`:

```bash
git clone $REPO ~/.config/nvim/
```

You can headlessly update LazyVim with:

```bash
nvim --headless '+Lazy! sync' +qa
```
